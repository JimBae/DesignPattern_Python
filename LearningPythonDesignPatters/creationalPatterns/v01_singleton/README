we	explored	design	patterns	and	their	classifications.
As	we	area aware,	design	patterns	can	be	classified	under	three	main	categories:	structural,
behavioral,	and	creational	patterns.
In	this	chapter,	we	will	go	through	the	Singleton	design	patternâ€”one	of	the	simplest	and
well-known	Creational	design	patterns	used	in	application	development.	This	chapter	will
give	you	a	brief	introduction	to	the	Singleton	pattern,	take	you	through	a	real-world
example	where	this	pattern	can	be	used,	and	explain	it	in	detail	with	the	help	of	Python
implementations.	You	will	learn	about	the	Monostate	(or	Borg)	design	pattern	that	is	a
variant	of	the	Singleton	design	pattern.
In	this	chapter,	we	will	cover	the	following	topics	in	brief:
An	understanding	of	the	Singleton	design	pattern
A	real-world	example	of	the	Singleton	pattern
The	Singleton	pattern	implementation	in	Python
The	Monostate	(Borg)	pattern
At	the	end	of	the	chapter,	we	have	a	short	summary	on	Singletons.	This	will	help	you
think	independently	about	some	of	the	aspects	of	the	Singleton	design	pattern.
